# Guess the number

It is a simple game that gets the user input to obtain the range of numbers to guess from. Once the range is defined, it automatically generates a random number within the range for the user to guess. The user is only allowed to guess the number within a limited amount of chances. Once the conditions are met, the user either wins and is asked if they want to play again or the game ends.
